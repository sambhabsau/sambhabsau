Ontology is a blockchain/distributed ledger
network which combines a distributed identity
system, distributed data exchange, distributed data
collaboration, distributed procedure protocols,
distributed communities, distributed attestation, and
various industry-specific modules. Together this builds
the infrastructure for a peer-to-peer trust network
which is cross-chain, cross-system, cross-industry,
cross-application, and cross-device.

The Three Dimensions of Trust
Trust is a key component in human organization and social
collaboration. Trust has become the core requirement
of social and economic partnership that has been built
up through technology, law, and community throughout

PART I. TRUST SYSTEMS AND ONTOLOGY

Ontology's Ethos

Ontology has architected a distributed trust system. It
incorporates multiple trust types in an integrated protocol
system with various blockchains and databases. Multisource identities and multi-source data exchange protocols
have been implemented into the network, building a
distributed trust system that is cross-chain, cross-industry,
cross-system, cross-application, and cross-device.
Ontology aims to develop its trust ecosystem through
partnerships to provide distributed services including
distributed communities, data verification, data exchange,
and credit across industries.

4

PART I. TRUST SYSTEMS AND ONTOLOGY

Vision and Structure
Ontology’s Trust Network is a protocol network built with multiple
blockchains and systems to support use with all business types.
In order to meet the needs of different industries, the flexible
design structure is modularized, pluggable, and easily expandable.
Ontology applies blockchain technology to all business types,
providing blockchains, smart contracts, distributed verification
management, data exchange, and other protocols and APIs. Users
can easily develop distributed services through Ontology without
having previous knowledge of distributed networks.
