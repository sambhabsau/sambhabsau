2. Executive Summary
2.1 The Genesis
Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is one of the major
emerging mega technology trends of our century. By enabling trustless,
immutable and decentralized transactions, blockchain technology is
setting the foundation for a suite of new generation applications that
will dramatically reshape the internet and enable stronger and more
inclusive societies.
The mission of Crypto.com is to accelerate the world’s transition to
crypto. The Crypto.com team has a clear vision to put cryptocurrency in
every wallet with a strong focus on real-life use cases.
It took Crypto.com a little over 2 years to launch the key product in its
consumer offering: a globally accepted payment card - the MCO Visa
Card. The reason for this is simple: traditional payment networks do
not natively accept crypto today. It makes for a slow, expensive go-tomarket process, heavily limiting the number of people we can introduce
to the crypto ecosystem.
The Crypto.com Chain was created to address this problem.

2.2 Problem Statement
Traditional fiat payment systems are built on legacy infrastructure
that makes it difficult to embrace new innovative payment forms like
cryptocurrency.
Traditional fiat payment systems have key characteristics:
heavily centralized, controlled by strict rules
costly for participants (in particular merchants); and
limited flexibility (e.g., challenging to onboard new innovations/
currencies easily)
In several countries, more modern fiat payment solutions have already
emerged and nearly replaced the traditional fiat payment system (e.g.,
Alipay/WeChat Pay in China).
Additionally, in our view existing decentralised cryptocurrency systems/
blockchains are not yet efficient or customized enough to provide a
good alternative to traditional fiat networks.

2.3 Mission & Vision
Mission:

Accelerate the World’s
Transition to Cryptocurrency

Vision:

The best way to pay and be paid
in crypto, anywhere, any crypto,
for free.
We strongly believe that decentralisation is an important part of
building a better society for everyone and by accelerating the world’s
transition to cryptocurrency we are helping the world move in this
direction.
We will achieve this by building on one side, a network of
cryptocurrency projects, and on the other side, focus on developing
merchants’ ability to accept crypto as a form of payment (please refer
to the diagram below).
We intend that Crypto.com Chain will be a high performing native
blockchain solution, which will make the transaction flows between
crypto users and merchants accepting crypto seamless, cost-efficient
and secure.

2.4 Go-to-Market Strategy
The key differentiator for the Crypto.com Chain is its clear go-to-market
strategy, which will result in rapid adoption.
There are four disruptive forces that underpin our strategy:
great offers for customers to financially incentivise usage of
crypto
no transaction fees for merchants
seamless user experience
decentralized protocol to process the transactions
Three out of four were previously successfully deployed by China’s leading
payment networks. The Crypto.com Chain is essentially a decentralized
mobile cryptocurrency payment solution built on blockchain.
Building a global payment network is a multi-year effort. The Crypto.com
Chain rollout will happen in stages, substantially increasing the speed of
adoption and lowering execution risk.

In Phase One
We will focus on a solution for online merchants to accept crypto.
“Crypto.com Pay” button, integrated via our API with a few lines of code.
Merchants will be incentivised to deploy it by not paying any fees and
additionally being able to offer substantial discounts to their customers.
Customers will pay using the Crypto.com app. Settlement will happen
off-chain.

In Phase Two
Following launch of our testnet, we will onboard more cryptocurrency
projects to allow customers to pay with multiple apps. More online
merchants will be onboarded, both directly and via integrations with
existing payment gateways and e-commerce providers. Settlement
will still happen off-chain at this stage.

Crypto.com

12

In Phase Three
Following launch of our mainnet, we will switch settlement to onchain. Crypto.com will still play substantial role in the network. Offline
merchant acquisition will begin.

In Phase Four
Gradual network decentralization will take place, with independent
parties replacing Crypto.com, which will move from a key settlement
agent role to the protocol code contributor & maintainer role.

2.6 Fiat Institutions Support
Our stated vision is to accelerate the world’s transition to
cryptocurrencies, and as such, we are extending an open invitation
to existing fiat institutions (e.g., card networks, payment gateways,
banks), who would like to add cryptocurrency as an accepted form
of payment in a secure, compliant and cost-effective manner.
We intend that Crypto.com Chain will address key challenges faced
by those fiat institutions in relation to cryptocurrency:
safe custody of those digital assets
on-chain and off-chain settlement in a timely and cost-effective
manner
volatility of those assets, especially in between settlements
multi-cryptocurrency management and support
Crypto.com will offer supporting technology solutions required to
meet compliance and regulatory requirements for FIs.
We intend that Crypto.com Chain will enable these institutions to:
Easily integrate cryptocurrency within their existing toolkit with
a few lines of code thanks to the ‘Crypto.com Simple SDK’ and
our APIs in record time (less than 24h integration)1
Have the flexibility to set their own rules and parameters from a
business model and compliance standpoint
Get a direct access (24h/ 7day) to our best-in-class Customer
Service team

3. Network & Technology
3.1

Customer Experience
The customer journey for crypto payment using the Crypto.com
Chain is intended to be frictionless and versatile. The steps
required will involve:
1

customer opens their existing participating crypto wallet or
exchange account;

2

customer shows QR code and scans it at the merchant
location, or customer scans merchant QR code; and

3

customer confirms payment and payment is processed:
customer account is debited; and
merchant account is credited in CRO, BTC and/or fiat
currencies as per its preferences

If a purchase does not go as planned, customers will be covered
by Crypto.com BlockShield Buyer Protection Program (B2P2)
leveraging the Proof of Goods & Services Delivered (PoGSD)
verification at participating merchants.
After each purchase, customer will be asked to indicate onchain whether the good or service they have received was
significantly as described (as per defined Crypto.com Chain
guidelines).
In case of dispute, customer will be able to submit a request
through the Crypto.com Chain dispute resolution platform and
reach a direct settlement with the merchant.

Crypto.com

3.2

18

Customer Acquirer
In order to become an acquirer node and offer clients access
to the global Crypto.com Network, cryptocurrency projects will
have to follow the below steps:
1

sign a standard agreement, covering processing, settlement
and dispute resolution, etc.;

2

pass a compliance audit;

3

lockup minimum CRO quantity;

4

integrate SDK; and

5

pass user acceptance testing on Crypto.com Testnet.

3.3

Merchant Experience
Merchant implementation requirements are minimal and provide
flexibility in accepting fiat and crypto:

3.4

1

merchants use their existing payment terminal (“POS”), or
integrate Crypto.com online payment gateway (single line
of code from our SDK) or simply add our “Crypto.com Pay”
payment button;

2

customers pay using their wallet or exchange account; and

3

merchants receive all their payments instantly in CRO or
stable coins, T+2 in fiat

Merchant Acquirer
Crypto.com will run a global business development team to drive
acceptance, using our relationships with the payments industry
and balance sheet strength to incentivise players to join the
Crypto.com Network. We view this as a process that will never
stop, but is likely to reach critical mass if we hit the 20 million
merchant POS milestone.

Crypto.com

19

We are aiming for different strategies and distribution channels
to be targeted, including:
direct-to-merchant deals, both online and offline;
online merchants - self-service payment gateway with one-lineof-code integration; and
offline merchants - deals with acquirers currently accepting
credit cards, debit cards, Alipay and Wechat Pay
For all types of acquirers, we have a powerful value proposition:
growing market: access to 40 million consumers globally who
currently hold crypto - with this number expected to grow to
hundreds of millions in the course over the next 24 months;
lower fees: zero merchant processing fees compared to fiat,
resulting in higher margins for the merchants;
minimal integration effort; and
co-marketing, including financial incentives

3.5 Network Potential
Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet creation have experienced explosive
growth (>10x) respectively from 2013 to 2015 and 2016 to 2018.
We expect wallet creation growth to continue in the future but
with a significantly more moderate CAGR down to 30-40% in the
later years.

3.6 Network Inclusion
Crypto.com will open up its protocol for customers and
merchants who would like to transact directly on this next
generation crypto payment chain without going through an
acquirer.
We intend that:
Direct participants will be able to leverage the power of the
Crypto.com Chain to create community closed-loop payment
channels to settle cryptocurrency payments for free.
Customers and merchants will act as their own acquirers and
hence will need to stake CRO to the network to be able to
participate in and process peer-to-peer transactions.
Crypto.com will provide participants with an easy-to-use
wallet application (“App”) with deposit/withdraw features
and stake and pay features to support this decentralized
process.

3.7 Network Decentralization
Crypto.com Chain will be built with complete decentralization in
mind.
In the long-term, Crypto.com Chain will be able to run without
Crypto.com entities as we develop the key pieces of architecture
and technology to enable it:
Trust-less mechanisms to increase access to transaction
validation nodes
Built-in and proven security protocols to keep bad actors at bay
Balanced incentives for valued added contributors and
disincentives for free-riders
Upgradability and flexibility of the chain through community
code contributions

Airdrop allocation

Airdrop distribution
& transferability

28

For instance, for every 1000 MCO tokens held
on the Crypto.com Wallet App at Airdrop
snapshot date, you will be awarded 5276 CRO
tokens.
Your monthly airdrop allocation will be distributed
in the first week after an airdrop snapshot; and will
be locked for a period of 12 months.
After 12 months, your airdrop allocation will be
released into your Crypto.com Wallet App based
on the following rules:

MCO minimum
balance over 12
months (as a % of
snapshot balance)

Airdrop allocation amount

100% or more

Receive full (100%) allocation of CRO

50% - 100%

Receive a proportionally-reduced quantity
of CRO allocation based on the lowest level
held during the 12 month period.
For example , if you sell 20% of your MCO
holdings during the 12 months, you will
receive an 80% allocation of CRO.

Less than 50%

Result in total loss of your CRO airdrop
allocation.
For example , if you sell 60% of your MCO
holdings during the 12 months, you will not
receive any CRO allocation.

UPDATE: Following feedback from the community, we are announcing that
MCO tokens held by Crypto.com will not be eligible for the CRO airdrop. All
unallocated CRO airdrop tokens will be used for Community development
activities.
UPDATE: Following input from the community, we are relaxing the airdrop
allocation rules so that you will no longer lose your entire allocation of CRO by
selling MCO during the 12 months holding period (see above updated airdrop
distribution & transferability section).
