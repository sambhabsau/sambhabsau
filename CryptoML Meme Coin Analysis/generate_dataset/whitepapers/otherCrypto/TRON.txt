I. Overall technical framework diagram

The overall technical architecture consists of three platforms:
1. Social media platform: this is an application layer;
2. Block-chain platform: a core block chain-based functional module is offered:
(1) Contract layer: a multilingual smart contracts platform;
(2) Consensus layer: a Fast Paxos-based PoS consensus algorithm.
3. P2P-based distributed storage system: a support located at the bottom:
(1) Network layer: customized content-addressable P2P storage network;
(2) Data layer: data storage is based on LevelDB/CouchDB.

A. Tron Social Media Platform
Through the use of many existing mature technologies, wave field (TRON), as a
new content platform, provides security, scalability, and privacy, and simultaneously
allows the participants to actively contribute to the processing capacity of their
machine to build a user registration network. It also gives positive contributors the
privilege to send advertisements to the whole network to incentivize (of course this
group text messaging will be limited in number).

1. The user registers P2P network
Centerless, but secure user registration, is implemented through the blockchain
mechanism, and the same mechanism has been applied in Bitcoin without the need for
central authorization, which avoids double spend difficulties. The blockchain ensures

TRON.NETWORK

no duplicate registration, and the newly-registered users must obtain the confirmation
of multiple blocks before taking effect, i.e. notarization. Each block is defined as:

H (Blocki) provides Proof-of-Work to prove that the user received satisfying Nonce
value in Noncei space through violent solving; meanwhile occasional hash collision is
avoided through verification. The difficulty of solving is determined by the difficulty
value, and the number of blocks generated per hour is automatically set by the system,
which is similar to the Bitcoin network.

New user j must broadcast UserRegj when registering online, and after receiving the
broadcast message, other nodes must prove the proof-of-Work of H (UserRegj), which
will prevent denial of service attacks by false registration. This workload is much
smaller than the workload of the blockchain; typically, a few minutes of computation
can solve the problem.
The blockchain provides a mapping from the user name Usernamej to the user public
key PUBKj, a dictionary that can be publicly queried.
The node must verify the uniqueness of Usernamej before adding Usernamej to the
new block, but there is an exception: if the newly-registered key is signed by the
previously known public and private keys, then it may be replaced. In addition, the IDj
uniqueness and the proof-of-Work of UserRegj should be also proved when receiving
the new block.
Usernamej also has the maximum size and the allowable character limit to protect
the ID space from the hash attacks.
SpamMsgj is a broadcast message (called "Promoted" message) that sends the
Promoted message as a reward to nodes that actively participate in block generation.

2. Routable DHT overlay network
The second network is a P2P overlay network similar to Kademlia, which is mainly
used for resource storage and searching content, and also for direct delivery of
notifications between users.
Using the user's ID as the network node ID seems like a good choice, but this leads
to the exposure of the user's identity and location, breaking the system's privacy.
Therefore, hashing the IP address and the node’s port number to identify the node and
taking it as the node's name in the DHT network can also avoid the sybil attack:

The package delivered from IDsrc to IDdst in DHT network is defined as follows:

The payload is signed through user IDj, the IDj may be different from other users of
IDsrc during package retransmission/refresh.

TRON.NETWORK

These functions constitute the third layer function of the concept model of the DHT
overlay network. The above layer is the "application layer", which provides the data
storage primitive to PUT and GET, PUT is defined as follows:

Before accepting the storage request, the destination node needs to do the following
rule checking:
 IDdst = H（target）：ensure the correct calculation of the destination address;
 IDdst is the neighbor of IDnode that actually receives the request;
 IDj = H（owner）: verify when restype is "single";
 seq is larger than stored old value seqold, which is also verified when
restype is "single";
 time is a valid time (i.e. not a future time value).
Restype defines resource types. There are two possible values, "single" and "multi."
Single represents resources that can only key owners can update; multi represents
responses from different users (i.e., replies to a post). For a single type, the node stores
only a single value, and for the multi type, the new PUT request appends the value to
the list. Both types of storage can set the expiration time, and the corresponding storage
will be deleted from the system after the setting time, so that the expired data will be
automatically cleared. Primitive data retrieval GET can also operate on two types of
storage resources, other non-storage resources related to the dynamic content also can
achieve similar access operations, so as to share the same API interface.

3. User contents
The k-th message of user j is defined as:
MSGk is content, k is a monotone increasing number, possible values of type include:
the new posts, replies, retransmission (RT), direct messages (DM), REPLYk is an
optional domain, which provides reference of the original message in response
/retransmission and is defined as:

Representing the original message is the k'-th message of the user j'.
The contents are simultaneously shared in two overlay networks:
1. Stored in DHT as a short-term storage value; and
2. Archived like files in BitTorrent network.
When the new content is created, the client-side must send a PUT request to the
following addresses:

IDUserPost_jk is the destination storage node’s address in the second DHT network,

TRON.NETWORK

providing the retrieval capability of any content.
IDswarm_j is the gateway address of torrent swarm group related to the content of the
user Usernamej in the third network, and this torrent contains all the content of a given
user j, which provides quick distribution and sharing of content based BitTorrent
protocol and is independent of the second DHT network. The neighbor node of IDswarm_j
needs to join the swarm cluster of user j to help the storage and distribution of content,
provide data reliability and better data distribution performance; similarly, the neighbor
node of IDUserPost_jk also needs to store the same values stored by IDUserPost_jk.
The swarm group mechanism solves the problem of fast and efficient notifications
and distribution of new content, so that the user's followers don't have to always poll
the DHT network address to determine whether new content is generated.

3.1 Direct message (DM)
Users posting content can also be delivered by direct message, but only if the
message receiver is a follower of user k.

Except the for the content difference(now is [PUBKl(DMk)，H(DMk)]) , there is no
difference from regular posts. DM will only be received by user l who has successfully
decrypted. Although other followers can also receive the message, they cannot decrypt
the message, nor can they perceive who is the final receiver. Encryption is based on the
ECIS elliptic curve encryption algorithm.

3.2 User content torrent/tracker rule
1. In hashing space, the online neighbor nodes within a certain distance from
IDswarm_j need to join the corresponding Swarm;
2. When IDswarm_j's neighbor receives new content from the DHT network, it must
work as a gateway for BitTorrent network to incorporate content into a file-like archive
structure;
3. BitTorrent tracker is read-only multi-value list storage. Its hash address is
calculated as:

4. The follower of user j should join in the corresponding swarm to receive real-time
content update, so as to obtain the address of the initial Peer through the primitive GET
query of IDtracker_j;
5. IDtracker_j is different from other storage values because it is read-only, which
prevents the tracker attack and contains the swarm members’ privacy. The list of IP
addresses is obtained through the swarm protocol, which requires the online neighbor
node of IDtracker_j to join the swarm.
6. Swarm members can only know each other through IP address, and BitTorrent
does not provide any information about the user name.
7. There is no need for the hash of all user contents, because the contents (including

TRON.NETWORK

DM) have been signed to verify the integrity of the content;
8. The added value k when generating new content is broadcasted directly through
flooding in the Swarm;
9. Members of the Swarm will exchange the content lists, where members can
choose to save or request only the most recent content;
10. The seed node is the node selected to archive the content;
11. A content publishers (user j) can choose not to be member of the swarm group
(to protect privacy and hide IP address);
12. If the publisher chooses to be a swarm member, it does not have to follow the
IDswarm_j gateway mechanism, which will22 expose its own IP address;
13. Even if the publisher becomes a swarm member, it may not have to act as a seed
node;
14. The new block generation rate will impact the user's posting speed, and if a new
block is generated every 10 minutes, on average, 288 contents blocks can be released
daily.

4. User mention mechanism
If the new content refers to user j, the client-side also has to send a notification to
IDj, including the entire message content, to be routed through the DHT network.
The mention mechanism is the only function in the system that needs to be addressed
by user IDj instead of IDnodej, which may expose users' privacy information. An
alternative implementation mechanism is as follows:

The user name is hidden hash and a new address for receiving and accumulating all
mention is calculated, IDmention_j neighbor nodes will also participate in the storage of
mention, providing maximum reliability and storage performance. A bad thing about
this approach is that the user needs to poll this address periodically to determine if any
new mention is received.
The mention mechanism requires the collaboration of the client-side, and if it does
not send notification messages to the network, the user will not perceive that he has
been mentioned.

5. Explicit message request
User l can request a specific explicit message from user j without joining Swarm
group through directly retrieving the corresponding contents from IDUserPost_jk address
of the second DHT network, it supports functions of "message upstream".

6. Message downstream
A downstream trace of the message (such as a reply/RT query for a specific content
query) is relatively difficult to resolve, and a possible solution is to send a notification
to a storage address of a multi-valued list.

TRON.NETWORK

The stored value is the copy of all responses, which also requires the client sides to
work together.

7. Hash tag
Like the mention mechanism, the hash tag detects in the context of the new
message, and the copy of the message is sent to a specific multi-value list storage
address:

This is similar to a message downstream mechanism, but the difference is: the
hash tag creates a new Swarm group; and IDhashtagt neighbors must also join this
virtual Swarm. It is called virtual because the Swarm group does not share any file
content and is only used to realize the broadcast function for users who want to
monitor the hash tag.

8. Content search
A search for any content that appears can be realized by extending the
implementation of the hash tag to build a similar mechanism for the content that
appears. In order to reduce overhead and network transmission, corresponding
restrictions must be attached, such as restricting content size and excluding
prepositions. In addition, it can significantly reduce the storage overhead and the
system implementation complexity if the unified storage of content containing the
same content is stored in a temporary multi-valued list address. The address
calculation is as follows:

TRON content provides the following security, extensibility and privacy features:
1. The architecture itself provides elastic extensions, and no single company,
government or organization can close it;
2. The distributed user registration mechanism is as secure as Bitcoin transactions,
providing non-centralized content authentication;
3. Users are more eager to register early so they can select their favorite user
name.
4. The common user naming method and discarding the long encryption hash
allow users to have a better use experience.
5. Public key substitution mechanism allows users to change their key pair when
security is threatened;
6. The main functions of other blogging systems are included, such as user name
search, message tracing, mention, encrypted message, hash tag and content search.
7. The ability to send notifications to and request resources from specific user via
DHT routing, whether the user is online or not;

TRON.NETWORK

8. The architecture provides incentives for participating nodes to have the privilege
of sending broadcast messages;
9. Users’ public content and hashtags can be accessed through read-only web
interface, which does not break the security of the system;
10. Resource-constrained client sides can be optimized, for example, by not
storing all blockchains but only the hash values of the blocks. In order to search for a
particular user, they can inquire network which block contains the user's registration,
and the client-side only have to download the desired block without reducing security
and verify data integrity through some branches of the Merkle Tree.

B. Blockchain platform

1. Introduction

TRON.NETWORK

TRON contains consensus engine, ABCI, UTXO, smart contracts and other
modules. Consensus engine is the core, application connects with consensus engine
by ABCI to form a Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine, which can be implemented
in any programming language.
TRON blockchain platform has the following characteristics:
1. Scalability: TRON blockchaincan be extended through the side chain, which
means that not only currency transactions, legally binding contracts and certificates,
audio and video files can be stored in the blockchain database;
2. Decentralization: Without an agency, all nodes have the same rights and
obligations, any node stopping working will not affect the overall operation of the
system.
3. Trustless environment: All nodes in the system can be traded without trust.
Because the operation of the database and the entire system is open and transparent,
the nodes can not deceive each other;
4. Consistency: The data information between nodes is consistent;
5. Fault-tolerant: The system can accommodate 1/3 node Byzantine failure;
6. Scalability Account Model: UTXO Model + Account Abstraction. TRON has
also made targeted improvements on the premise of UTXO's easy-to-parallel
computing model. To make data easy to manage and easy to program, TRON
introduces the world state-lightweight state tree concept, each of which maintains a
global world state, the global state has the features of quickly find, can not be
changed, easy to provide proof.

2. Software hierarchy

TRON.NETWORK

Software level is divided into two parts. The first part includesAPIs, SDKs and
CLI, which are mainly used for calling an external provider for
convenientdevelopment.The second part includesWallet Module, Blockchain Module
and SmartContract Module, provides a storage interface, making the data of each
modulepersistent.

3. UTXO

TRON.NETWORK

In the UTXO model, it is possible to transparently trace back the history of each
transaction through the public ledger. The UTXO model has parallel processing
capability to initialize transactions among multiple addresses indicating the
extensibility.
Additionally, the UTXO model supports privacy protection in that users can use
Change Address as the output of a UTXO. The target of TRON is based on smart
contracts.
Compared with the UTXO model, Ethereum is an account based system. In
Ethereum, balance management resembles a bank account in the real world. Every
newly generated block potentially influences the global status of other accounts.
Every account has its own balance, storage and code-space base. users perform P2P
transactions via client remote procedure calls. Although sending messages to each
account via smart contracts is possible, these internal transactions are only visible in
the balance of each account and tracking them on the public ledger of Ethereum is a
challenge.
Based on the discussion above, we consider the Ethereum account model to be a
scalability bottleneck. By contrast. The UTXO model of bitcoin has enhanced
network efficiency with obvious advantages. Therefore, we build the block-chain
based on the UTXO model and abstract the concept of the account, making it more
intuitive understanding of the real world, which is the original intention of TRON.

4. Smart contract

TRON.NETWORK

Certainty and Termination are two properties of a smart contract. When designing
a smart contract system, non-deterministic factors need to be excluded.
Bitcoin has a set of scripting engines, the instruction set is very simple and nonTuring complete, with termination, so bitcoin smart contracts are certain. The
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment for Ethereum smart
contracts. The system functions for Ethereum smart contracts are not
nondeterministic, but the contract's call path can be nondeterministic and result in a
scalable performance Losses, it uses meter to achieve the termination. The
Hyperledger Fabric smart contract uses Docker as the execution environment. Docker
is a lightweight virtualization technology, under the blockchain Docker is a “heavier”
execution environment, which is where the performance bottlenecks of Fabric,
currently only up to hundreds of TPS per second, which uses a timer to achieve
Termination.
In order to keepwith the advantages of certainty, termination, and lightweight of
virtual machines and the language flexibility of container programming, TRON is
poised to develop the TRON Virtual Machine as an execution environment for its
smart contracts in the future. The TVMboots very fast, occupies less resources. TRON
virtual machine data manipulation instructions are directly to the array and complex
data structures to provide support. These will enhance the operational performance of
TRON smart contracts. The TRON Network plans to charge for the operation and
storage of tokens and smart contracts to achieve economic incentives to book-keeping
persons and to prevent the abuse of resources.
In the future TRON smart contract developers can use almost any high-level
language they are good at for TRON smart contract development. The first language
support are java, Go etc. Tron plans to provide compilers and plug-ins for these
languages to compile high-level languages into the instruction sets supported by
TRON virtual machines.
The TRON smart contract model shown above is a piece of code (a smart contract)
that runs on a smart contract virtual machine and is deployed on a shared, replicated

TRON.NETWORK

ledger (blockchain). TRON has a life cycle for smart contracts management,
respectively are: the establishment, deployment, development, rollback, termination.
It can maintain its own status, control its own asset value and receive external
information, transactions or external information and transactions to respond.

5. Consensus
The consensus of TRON adopts a three-step strategy. The first step is to adopt a
Kafka-based technology system to implement a centralized consensus algorithm. The
purpose of TRON is to achieve system joint debugging and functional integration.
The second step is to use Raft-based distributed consensus mechanism to realize
the centralized and distributed leapfrogging. This step gradually improves the
functions of network and distribution and lays the foundation for the eventual
realization of a wide distribution with no logical center.
The third step is to realize the Consensus mechanism of PoS and realize the
Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus based on the "Margin Mechanism + Epoch
Confirmation" and the compatibility consensus between PoS and PoW.
TRON is currently open source code to achieve a consensus algorithm for the first
phase of the center. The second phase of the distributed consensus algorithm is under
development and testing.

6. Protocol Buffer based object coding and serialization

TRON.NETWORK

6.1 Example
Proto code:
message Block {
repeated Transaction transactions = 1;
BlockHeaderblockHeader = 2;
}

Serialization:
Block.Builder block = Block.newBuilder()
.setTransactions(transactions)
.setBlockHeader(blochHeader)
.build();

TRON.NETWORK

byte[] blockData = block.toByteArray();
byte[] keyData = block.getHash();
DB.saveBlock(keyData, blockData);

Deserialize:
byte[] keyData = block.getHash();
byte[] blockData = DB.getBlock(keyData);
Block block = Block.parseFrom(blockData).toBuilder().build();

C. Tron Content Storage
1. File Storage Protocol
TRON’s bottom layer consists of a group of multi-layer protocol stacks with
various implementation models for each layer and is integrated in modules.
Corresponding interface standards are defined between layers, including the following
five levels:
1. Name layer: a self-certified PKI namespace
2. MerkleDAG layer: data structure format
3. Exchange layer: block transmission and copy
4. Routing layer: locating peer nodes and objects
5. Network layer: establishing connection among peer nodes

1.1 Node and identification
"TRON node" is the program that can locate, release and copy MerleDAG. TRON
network adopts node identification based on PKI (Public Key Infrastructure); the node
is shown as NodeId, which is the Ciphertext Hash of Public Key. Node will store its
public and private keys (private key will be protected by password). Users can freely
establish and initiate a “new” node in every boot, which will deprive the network the
profit achieved from former node running. The system has an incentive mechanism to
make users maintain the same node.
type NodeId Multihash
type Multihash []byte
// self-describing cryptographic hash digest
type PublicKey []byte
type PrivateKey []byte
// self-describing keys
Type Node struct {
NodeId NodeID
PubKey PublicKey
PriKey PrivateKey
}

The generation mechanism of NodeId is as follows:
difficulty = <integer parameter>
n = Node{}

TRON.NETWORK

do {
n.PubKey, n.PrivKey = PKI.genKeyPair()
n.NodeId = hash(n.PubKey)
p = count_preceding_zero_bits(hash(n.NodeId))
} while (p < difficulty)

When the connection is established, the nodes will exchange public keys among
each other and, check if the hash of node public key is equal to the NodeId
hash(other.PublicKey) equals other.NodeId of peer node, if not, the connection will be
terminated.

1.2 Multihash and updatable hash
All hashes in TRON will be encoded with multihash, which is a self-describing
hash format. The hash function should be used in accordance with specific security
requirements. The encryption system is updatable, which means the system can
switch to a stronger hash algorithm when a current hash function cannot meet more
strict security requirements. But there is indeed a price to be paid, the object needs to
be rehashed and the connection needs to be rebuilt. This way of not defining the
length of a hash digest in advance allows for the tool used today can to work normally
even if it is switched to a longer hash function tomorrow.
The hash digest value is stored in multihash format, including a short header,
specified hash function and byte length of digest, For instance:
<function code><digest length><digest bytes>
The current TRON node must support the following hash algorithm: sha2-256,
sha2-512 and sha3.

1.3 Network layer
Provide point-to-point reliable and unreliable transmission between two TRON
nodes, and process:
1. NAT traversal—punching, port mapping and relaying;
2. Support various transport protocols—TCP, SCTP, UTP…
3. Support encryption and digital signature;
4. Multiplexing—multiplex connection, stream and protocol…

1.4 The routing layer: locating peer nodes and data
Routing layer serves for two purposes:
1. Node-routing—searching for other nodes;
2. Content routing—searching for data released to TRON.
Routing layer defines an interface, and all implementations meet or realize the
interface can be linked to TRON, for instance: DHTs, mdns, snr, dns. The
corresponding interface definition is as follows:

TRON.NETWORK

1.5 Block swap: transmitting content-addressable data
TRON’s block swap layer is responsible for data transmission coordination. Once
the nodes are aware of each other and establish connection, content-addressable
blocks can be transmitted through swap agreement. Note that the term "swap" in this
context does not refer to a swap in the sense of a finaical market transaction as
defined in the US Commodity Exchange Act. It is a technical term of art dealing with
the TRON platform code’s distribution of content. The block swap layer is the
interface definition, and all implementations meet or realize the interface can achieve
seamless access, for instance:
1. Bitswap: current implementation, which is the generalization implementation of
BitTorrent, supports the swap of any DAG;
2. HTTP: simple HTTP implementations can be used between HTTP clients and
servers.
BitSwap is a block transmission agreement similar to BitTorrent—where nodes
represent the expected block set with want_list, and represent the data block set they
can provide with have_list. Unlike BitTorrent, block swapped by BitSwap is not
limited to a single torrent. BitSwap serves as a persistent market, nodes exchange
blocks through BitSwap market, the node can obtain their favored block sets, and
these block sets may be completely unrelated files from the file system. Sometimes, in
exchange, a node may have no blocks needed by other nodes, and it will help find
blocks it needs – these get the needed block from each other, and such incentives can
help the cache and distribution of rare blocks.

1.5.1 BitSwap credit
The agreement must urge the nodes to be the seed because they might not have the
blocks needed by other nodes. Therefore, BitSwap nodes will actively deliver blocks
to other peer nodes, and the agreement must prevent the existence of greedy nodes
that load little and never share their blocks. A simple system similar to credits can
solve these problems.
1. An node track its number of bytes exchanged with other nodes;
2. Nodes transmit blocks to indebted nodes in form of probability, the higher the

TRON.NETWORK

debt of indebted node is, the lower probability of block transmission will be.
It should be noticed that if the node decides not to transmit a block to the opposite
end, then it cannot transmit a block to the ignored correspondent node within the
following ignore_cooldown time. This prevents the submitter from escaping from
repeatedly sending blocks.

1.5.2 BitSwap strategy
The node’s strategy to send blocks directly influences the performance of block
swapping. It should meet the following objectives:
1. Maximize the node and the overall transaction performance;
2. Prevent greedy nodes from taking advantage of or reducing the swapping
performance;
3. Efficient and exclusive to other strategies;
4. Be friendly to the credit node.
A practical strategy selection is Sigmoid function, the defined debt ratio r is:

At a given r, the probability of sending to indebted node will be calculated as:

The sending probability drops dramatically with the rising of debt ratio. Debt ratio
is the measurement of credit, which is friendly to previous nodes that have swapped
many blocks and unfriendly to unknown or untrusted nodes.

1.5.3 BitSwap accounts
The BitSwap node will keep accounts of block swaps, which helps node track
history and avoid being cheated. When connection is established, the BitSwap nodes
will exchange account information. If the information is not matched exactly, the
accounts will be deleted and reinitialized, and all profits and debts will be lost. This
method seems to have a loophole for malicious nodes to delete debts by way of
intentionally “losing” accounts, but that is impossible because nodes cannot
accumulate enough debts. Furthermore, it will lose all the previously-accumulated
debt, and other nodes will consider it abnormal behavior and refuse to swap.

TRON.NETWORK

The account information history will not influence the normal operation, and only
recent account items are useful. The node can also choose store or not to store
historical information.

2. Self-operation of Storage Network
TRON is a centerless storage network, which turns the storage from cloud model
to market model based on algorithms and rules. The market is based on blockchain
and trade in virtual currency: the miner earns TRX by providing storage for clients; on
the contrary, the clients spends TRX to hire miner to store and dispatch data. Similar
to Bitcoin, offered by miners, which provides a useful client-side service (unlike
Bitcoin, the miners’ work is only useful for blockchain consensus) and is a strong
incentive to drive miners to contribute as much storage space as possible to client-side
rent. The agreement will integrate these resources into a self-healing storage network
for external use, and the network will realize its robustness by copying and dispersing
stored content and automatically detect and repair replication errors. The client side
can choose different replication parameters to protect data according to different
threat degrees and levels. The storage network also provides other security guarantees
for clients such as end-to-end encryption of content, and the storage provider cannot
obtain the decryption key.

2.1 Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) algorithm
The server (prover, P) convinces the user (verifier, V) that its data D is replicated
and stored in multiple physical storage locations.

2.1.1 Seal operation
Seal operations include:
1. getting the public key of verifier’s stored data through asking verifier to prove
the pseudorandom and force the data copies to be correctly stored in independent
physical storage;
2. force the time required by copying the process to be longer than the expected
time required by responding to a Challenge.

2.1.2 PoRep algorithm flow
Create a copy: create a copy in Setup algorithm through the Seal operation and
provide the proof of successful execution.

Storage verification: The Prove algorithm produces storage verification for the

TRON.NETWORK

replica. The prover receives a random challenge c and determines one leaf Rc of
Merkle Tree R (root is rt), the prover produces the proof of Rc and the Merkle path to
rt.

Verification proof: Verify algorithm checks the validity of the storage verification
based on the data copy of the Markel tree root and the hash of the original data. The
verification is publicly verifiable: any distributed system node interested in this data
can check the validity of the storage verification.

2.1.3 PoSt algorithm flow
The Setup of PoSt is similar to Verify algorithm and PoRep. The Prove algorithm
produces Proof-of-Spacetime for data copy.

The prover receives random challenge from verifier and orderly generates Proofsof-Replication, then uses one proof output as the next output until t times of loop
iteration, as is shown in the following picture:

III. Technical solution

IV. The market size of entertainment and why TRON is necessary?
At present, the annual scale of global entertainment market has reached thousands of
billions 1 . Internet Revolution makes it possible for entertainment experience to be
globalized for the first time so as to generate numbers of entertainment giants at a level
of trillions on the world 2.
However, factors such as fragmentation of payment settlement and an insular feature of
the entertainment system, etc. have led to failures in completely releasing the potential
of the global entertainment industry.
1. The market size and growth of entertainment industry
Since the 21st century, entertainment industry all over the world keeps growing at a rate
of 5.6% on annual average. Among them, output value of the American entertainment
industry tops the list. In some developing countries such as India, China and Brazil, etc.,

TRON.NETWORK

entertainment industry is making progress strongly and annual average increases in
these countries all exceed 10% 3. The reason why the entertainment industry can leap
forward at full speed today is that a complete set of comprehensive recreation system
centering around life style, gambling and game playing has been established for it as its
foundation. The above aspects have been always the “cash cow” of the entertainment
industry and their integration with network releases the giant potential of entertainment
to a greater extent.
With the renovation and development of global internet technology and the awakening
of consumers’ self-awareness, industries falling into the category of life style are rising
quickly. The 2016 Global Social Media Study Summary indicates that among nearly
7.4 billion of the global population, the number of active users of social media has
reached 2.307 billion; overlord status f traditional social applications such as Facebook,
etc. has been shaken to a certain degree; and, young users tend to have more diversified
application selections 4 . Throughout the world, values for applications of life style,
including Tinder and Instagram, etc., have been estimated to break through ten billions
of dollars 5 and are forging recreational life of human beings in an unprecedented
manner. In this process, broad business development opportunities are raised. Match
Group, the largest online dating group of American, went public on November 19, 2015.
On that day, it raised $ 0.536 billion and its aggregate market value exceeded $ 3.4
billion. Moreover, multiple well-known social apps are owned by it, such as Tinder and
OkCupid, etc.. 6Likewise, the Asia-Pacific market is booming and the development of
life style apps is especially spectacular in the Asian region, particularly China. Currently,
utilization frequencies of social networking software such as WeChat and QQ, etc. have
ranked Top 5 among social software on the world. Emerging diversified social apps
spring up one after another in a rising tendency. Taking social broadcaster software
industry in China for example, Momo as a benchmarking listed company in Chinese
broadcasting industry has been established for five years and its market value has
arrived at $ 8 billion. Up to now, the average rate of increase in each quarter remains at
50% and above 7. Other companies closely following it are YY (market value: $ 4 billion)
and Inke (market value: 7 billion RMB), etc. successively. All of them are growing
rapidly. In China, it can be said that “A Battle among Thousands of Broadcasting
Companies” has been put on the stage, which attracts ten billions of venture capital
funds 8. Clearly, not only are lifestyle apps becoming an indispensable part of users’ life
around the world, but considerable gains can be generated commercially as they are
featured with high gross margins, large flow and impressive interactions and
penetration.

A the end of 1980s, gambling industry rapidly rose all over the world. To 2002, its
global output value reached more than $ 900 billion and it turned into the world fourth
largest industry 9 . According to the Annual Report on World Gambling Industries,
earnings made by the global gambling industries in 2014 surpassed $ 4500.9 billion. As
predicted, their revenues in 2019 can be expected to reach $ 525 billion. 10 Now,
development tendency of the online gambling game industry is very prospective and
the scale of such a global market almost arrives at $ 5 billion 11 . Annual income of
modern gambling pioneers represented by William Hill and Ladbrokes breaks through
tens of billions 12. Additionally, Crown and MacauSlot of Asia begin to exhibit a growth
trend as well. Specific to countries with great powers of traditional gambling industries,
concrete industry forms there are quietly transformed into online gambling that will rise.
According to statistical data published by United Kingdom Gambling Commission
(UKGC) in 2016, revenue growth of offline gambling industry in UK flagged and even
negative growth occurred; by contrast, year-on-year growth of 4% was realized in the
online gambling industry when compared with that of the last year. As a result, the
online gambling industry became the largest category of UK gambling industry. 13

1990s, with the emerging of EA, Nintendo and Sony, etc., video game turned into an
important basis of European, American and Japanese entertainment industries. Since
the 21st century, it substantially suffers impacts of networking and a variety of new
game forms take form. 14 Online games can be referred to as the earliest “cash cow”
businesses in the circle of the Internet. As early as the end of the last century, some
famous online game manufacturers such as Blizzard Entertainment, etc. were born in
America and their values at present have broken through tens of billions 15. In recent
years, “phenomenal” mobile games have emerged in endlessly. For example, Clash of
Clans launched by Supercell that is a game company in Finland and Candy Crush
published by King Digital, a Swedish online game firm, and so on all have attracted
extensive attention and many players, which sufficiently reflects prosperity and
development of online game industry. 16 Currently, mobile online games occupy the
biggest market share all over the world. In 2016, market size of global video game
industry reached $ 99.6 billion; among which, that of mobile games takes $ 46.1 billion
equal to a proportion of 42%. While global mobile games thrive and develop today,
Asian-Pacific game market is expanding in a dramatically fast speed. According to the
prediction, revenues of the game industry in Asian-Pacific Region will take a percent
of 47% in the global total revenues in 2017, among which, proportion occupied by
China Market will be up to 26% surpassing America to rank first throughout the world.

Simultaneously, revenue growth of mobile games in China market rises rapidly. As
predicted, market size of the mobile game industry in China will arrive at $ 10 billion
in 2017, which increases by 41% if compared to that in 2015 ($ 7.1 billion). Clearly,
China’s mobile game market booms and it is also necessary to occupy a share in such
a giant emerging market. 17

To sum up, integration between the entertainment industry and the Internet at the global
angle of view is moving towards a new round of prosperity. At the time of locking
entertainment industry development trends in developed regions such as European
countries, importance should be also attached to the Asian-Pacific region as a giant
emerging market rapidly growing and the key to further development of the
entertainment industry. However, for the purpose of effectively grasping core markets
and users of the entertainment industry, simply transferring traditional entertainment
forms improved to the Internet together is far from enough. In order to stimulate the
endogenous vigor, in-depth integration of information should be carried out for the
entertainment industry renovated from perspectives of ideas and propositions.

2. Why TRON is necessary?
1. Information and credit sharing among entertainment systems. As for an
entertainment system constructed based on the Internet, userinfo and user credit are
cores of it. Due to short realization and existence cycles of the current entertainment
applications and systems, a single developer cannot preserve the credit system of a
user in a specific entertainment system. Consequently, each entertainment system
nearly exists like an information isolated island. TRON network provides an
effective means for userinfo existence and information docking between different
systems in the entire entertainment market, so as to break information barriers
among different applications. In this way, users are able to substantially lower
information input costs required by a particular application and developers realize
efficient interactions in the field of user identification to reduce expenses of repeat
authentication and prevent user identity information from being disclosed or stolen
by an intermediary agency. 18
2. Token circulation among entertainment systems. Regarding traditional online
entertainment industries, gross margins are high and volume of withdrawal and
investment transactions is large. Nevertheless, token barriers inherent in diverse
entertainment systems may cause rather high extra transaction costs to users that
employ diverse sub-systems/applications of a certain system; in other words, it is
extremely difficult for users to stride across different systems and applications.
Barrier-free tokens based on TRON network will fill up the blank of channels that
can be connected to various system settlement and payments in the entertainment
network, and make absolutely trustworthy transaction information flow come true.
Therefore, the trust relationship between the people in many social links and game

TRON.NETWORK

sessions, etc. turns into the trust between human beings and technology.
3. In-depth amalgamation of entertainment systems. TRON network constructs a
complete set of consensus mechanism to solve identification and individual credit
reporting issues related to network transactions by an extremely low cost. In
addition, it takes advantage of a point-to-point transactions to avoid a conventional
centralized settlement structure. At the same time, TRON network plays a role of
trustee among diverse users or developers to ensure authenticity and conformance
of credit assure. According to the above two aspects, running efficiency of the entire
globalized entertainment economy system can be enormously improved.
Furthermore, the decentralized operation mode of economy itself is a typical feature
of the market economy system. 19 Decrease in transaction cost will promote a
substantial rise of consumer demands, which incurs the flourish of a global
entertainment economy system.

V.

TRON business moduel

1．lifestyle
Two cores of social contacts with strangers and entertainment are credit and user level.
By sharing decentralized TRX information, social contact screening cost can be
reduced unprecedentedly. By joining TRON protocol, developers and users are able to
obtain TRX tokens given by the TRON foundation as a gift.
Below, examples of some application modes combined with modern entertainment
systems and the corresponding application scenarios in concrete are presented.
Tinder Schema
Every newly registered user is allowed to obtain TRX. Users praise each other one-toone by sliding to gain tokens. Each time a user is praised, he/she will earn TRX given
by the system. The user possessing more TRX tokens has better credit and higher level
of his/her entertainment behaviors. Thus, such a user can be favored by more other
high-quality users. In addition, the system also pushes users with higher scores. Token
growth limit is defined on a daily basis.
By virtue of settings, function of mutual gift presenting by sliding can be realized by
TRX between users. The behavior of presenting TRX as a gift will make the
corresponding user benefit from selecting more qualified and matched persons.
Online Live Streaming Schema
Every newly registered user is entitled to obtain TRX. As for anchors, they should
acquire tokens by being given a reward. Each time they are presented to currencies of
19

Davidson S, De Filippi P, Potts J. (2016). Economics of blockchain.

TRON.NETWORK

a certain magnitude, TRX can be obtained. As for users, they can get TRX when they
present currencies of the corresponding magnitude. Anchor of a higher TRX score has
a stronger performing capacity and is more popular among users. By contrast, user of a
higher TRX score has a more intensive power of consumption and should be a highpaying user endowed with a glory level by the platform. TRX can be also presented as
a gift among users by means of giving a reward and no upper limit has been imposed
on the amount of TRX obtained in each day.
Transaction among users
Users in the user transaction schema can acquire interactive services through a social
network site and get TRX provided that the transaction succeeds and both parties of the
transaction are satisfied. In the case of any party is discontent or triggers reporting, TRX
destruction may be incurred. Additionally, the user can also acquire TRX when the
volume of a transaction reaches a certain magnitude. Likewise, no upper limit has been
exerted on the amount of TRX obtained in each day.
Examples of the Application Scenario
A female user named Alice registers for an application of social contacts with strangers
in TRON and it then praised by 560 men who slides right; and, such a kind of behavior
is read by TRON network that thus subsequently gives Alice 56 TRX tokens as a reward.
A user Bob who notices that Alice has redeemed a point of 56 TRX send a contact
request to her.
Another user Candice comes to an agreement with Bob to provide chatting services.
However, Candice breaks their agreement after receive the earnest money of 200 USD
in virtual currency paid by Bob. Consequently, Bob initiates a smart contract of TRX
destruction against Candice. That is, Bob needs to spends 10 TRX on destroying 100
TRX owned by Candice, at the time of which, the earnest money in the transaction
deposit account is destroyed as well.
Another user Douglas who has been awarded with 2,500 USD as a gift in the live
streaming software receives 250 TRX presented by the system and his level is promoted
at the same time. Therefore, he is entitled to multiple anchor permissions such as
highlighting and broadcast starting push.
Another user Evan who has registered for social networking software in TRON injects
1,000 TRX simultaneously to achieve a higher level instantly and enjoy all social
networking privileges corresponding to 1,000 TRX. Moreover, system gives priority to
surrounding high-quality user push for Evan.
2. Betting
TRON makes it possible to construct decentralized online gaming platforms that are
equipped with a top-up system applicable to all virtual currencies and legal tender.

TRON.NETWORK

Based on TRON, developers are able to freely construct online gaming platforms so as
to further provide opportunities to ordinary investors to participate into the investment
platform.
A gaming platform takes the responsibility to issue TRX and keep behavior records.
The fundamental issuance rule is as follows.
In each case that virtual currencies of the corresponding magnitude have been spent,
TRX can be issued; or, when virtual currencies of a certain value have been earned,
TRX can be also issued without any upper limit.
Game developers can develop TRX gambling system to perform gaming gambling by
adopting TRX as the subject.
TRX injection is accepted. Users can resell TRX obtained by themselves, which leads
to address account destruction. Or, the user utilizes its own TRX to perform gaming
directly as TRON network accepts varieties of virtual currencies such as BTC,
Ethereum and EOS, and employs TRX as neutral currency to conduct settlement.
Examples of Application Scenarios
A user Alice who registers for a gaming application in TRON protocol wins some
virtual currencies of 1,000 USD by gaming with other users and is thus awarded with
10TRX.
Another user Bob invests ETH into the gaming application in TRON protocol; thus, he
gets a return of 10 ETH and is awarded with TRX.
Another user Candice lost some virtual currencies of 1,000 USD because of gaming
and is thus awarded with TRX as well.
3. Game
TRON makes it possible to construct decentralized online gaming platforms.
Developers are able to freely construct game platforms based on TRON so as to realize
game development crowdfunding and further provide opportunities to ordinary
investors to put investment into the game.
Benchmarking issuance rules of the game are as follows.
When the user spends a certain amount on purchasing within the range of the platform,
he/she obtains TRX.
TRX injection is accepted. Users can resell TRX obtained by themselves, which leads
to address account destruction. Or, users can directly top up TRX to obtain game props
in a way of consuming TRX; besides, tokens and TRX establishing market can be
issued for game applications to realize currency interconnection and interworking
among different game markets.

TRON.NETWORK

Examples of Application Scenarios
A user Alice who registers for a game application in TRON protocol consumes some
virtual currencies worth 1,000 USD and is thus rewarded with 10 TRX.
Another user Bob quit an internal battle of the game should accept credit punishment
and lose TRX correspondingly.
Another user Candice successfully receives another level and reward in a new game
application as he/she injects TRX obtained from gaming.
4. Entertainment File Sharing
Based on rules provided by TRON network, developers can offer ease-to-use multiplatform file synchronization applications. The greatest strength of such applications
lies in high speed transmission. In other words, the smart P2P technology is adopted to
segment files so as to further accelerate the synchronization; at the same time, AES
encryption is also conducted for such files to ensure both privacy and security. By virtue
of public key generation and key reading techniques, files are transmitted and read; in
this way, TRX can be awarded correspondingly after other users receive and download
them. Additionally, key reading itself can be linked to virtual currencies. In the case
that the other party pays the corresponding TRX or other virtual currencies, contents of
the encrypted file are obtained; that is, TRON makes it possible to implement paid data
transmission.
5. Mobile Application of TRX
TRON will provide official mobile end devices for TRX, including IOS and Android
platforms.
TWO
TWO is a new social networking application based on TRON protocol. By sliding left
or right, users of the opposite sex are screened. If both parities like each other
simultaneously, they will be matched for real-time video chatting. As for users, they

TRON.NETWORK

can register for TWO at the mobile terminal to directly acquire TRX rewards and access
TRX network to earn TRX by conducting social behaviors; but, they can be also
punished by means of deducting their TRX due to destructive social behaviors.

Peiwo APP
Peiwo APP is the largest mobile audio live streaming application and owns more than
10 of millions of registered users. The number of its monthly active users has also
broken through one million and the cumulative call duration goes beyond 2 billion
minutes. In 2018, “Peiwo” will take the lead in being compatible with TRON
network. It signifies that TRON protocol will transcend BTC and Ethereum to become
the first smart contract blockchain protocol whose wallet and user quantities exceed ten
million as far as all virtual currency protocols are concerned.

VI.

Operating of TRON

1. Operator
As followers of Tim Berners-Lee, the TRON team firmly believes that the Internet
belongs to all humankind since the day the protocol was born, instead of a profitable
tool for a fraction of people. Therefore, TRON established Tron Foundation in
Singapore, with the primary task to operate the TRON network publicly, fairly,
transparently, and not for profit, and offer support to TRON’s development team.
Tron Foundation’s establishment was approved by Singapore’s Accounting and
Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and is supervised by Singapore’s

TRON.NETWORK

corporate law. This Foundation is independently managed and run by a fiduciary
board or management committee and is independent of the government.
The Foundation does not have any commercial interests to support or participate in
public interest or private interest activities. The “profit” earned by the Foundation is
deemed surplus and will be kept as outlays for other activities instead of being
distributed among its members.
Please find the BizFile of Tron Foundation as below:
https://dn-peiwo-web.qbox.me/tron/Bizfile-Tron-Foundation-2017.07.28.pdf
2. Governance structure and voting
The Foundation has set up a three-tier organization structure to ensure the
reasonable use of funds and resources to promote openness, justice, and
transparency; to constantly advance the rapid growth of TRON protocol; to extend
the application scenarios of TRON protocol; and to attract more institutions,
companies, and organizations to enter the open-source TRON ecosystem:
