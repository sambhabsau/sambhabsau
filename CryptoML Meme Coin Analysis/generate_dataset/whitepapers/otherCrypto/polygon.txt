01 POLYGON LIGHTPAPER

Challenge

Ethereum is the blockchain development
platform of choice, but it has limitations:

Low throughput Poor User Experience (UX) No Sovereignty
Gas, Delayed PoW finality Shared throughput/clogging risk, tech stack
notcustomizable, governance dependence

Many projects are exploring Ethereum-compatible blockchains as a way to mitigate these limitations while still leveraging
Ethereum's thriving ecosystem. However, there is no specialized framework to build such blockchains nor a protocol to
connect them. This introduces significant development challenges and causes ecosystem fragmentation.

Technology

Polygon provides the core components
and tools to join the new, borderless
economy and society.

With Polygon, any project can have it's dedicated, optimized instance of Ethereum which combines the best features of
stand-alone blockchains (sovereignty, scalability, and flexibility) and Ethereum (security, interoperability and developer
experience). Additionally, these blockchains are compatible with all the existing Ethereum tools (Metamask, MyCrypto,
Remix, etc), and can exchange messages among themselves and with Ethereum.

06 THE POLYGON PROJECT

Polygon chains

Polygon supports two major types of
Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks:
stand-alone networks and networks that
leverage “security as a service”

Stand-alone chains

 

Fully sovereign Ethereum-compatible blockchain
networks. These networks are fully in charge of
their own security, i.e. have their own pool of
validators. Stand-alone chains offer the highest

level of independence and flexibility, with the

tradeoff of sometimes challenging validator

pool establishing.

  

Enterprise networks
Established projects with strong communities

Secured chains

Blockchain networks that use “security as a service”

instead of establishing their own validator pool. The

service can be provided either by Ethereum directly secu

(via fraud proofs or validity proofs) or by a pool of (aeaProoss) wateates)
professional validators (similar to Polkadot’s “shared
security”). Secured chains offer high level of security,

with the tradeoff of sacrificing a portion of wT

independence and flexibility. way peas

01

Ethereum layer

Polygon chains can use Ethereum, the most secure
programmable blockchain in the world, to host and
execute any mission-critical component of their
logic. This layer is implemented as a set of Ethereum
smart contracts, in charge of functions like:

—  Finality/checkpointing

— Staking

— Dispute Resolving

— Messaging between ETH and Polygon chains

C5 polygon

02

Security layer

A specialized, non-mandatory layer providing
“validators as a service" - a set of validators that
can periodically check validity of any Polygon chain
fora fee. This layer is normally implemented as a
meta blockchain that runs in parallel to Ethereum,
in charge of functions like:

— Validator Management
registration/deregistration, rewards, shuffling etc

— Polygon Chains Validation

Security layer is fully abstract and can have multiple
instances, implemented by different entities and
with different characteristics. It can also be
implemented directly on Ethereum, in which case
the Ethereum miners perform the validation.

This layer interprets and executes transactions that
are agreed upon and included in Polygon networks’
blockchains. It consists of two sublayers:

Our vision

We envision an open,
borderless world.

Aworld in which people and machines collaborate and exchange value globally and freely, without gatekeepers or
intermediaries. A world in which communities thrive, unconstrained by artificial borders and archaic regulations.

We will strive to empower everyone to effortlessly join this new, better world.
