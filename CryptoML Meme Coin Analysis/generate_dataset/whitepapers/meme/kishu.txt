Abstract

Littke Meme. Big Dream. Welcome to KISHU...

KISHU INU was created in April 2021
with the goal of being a decentralized
meme project with true purpose.

KISHU’s mission is to bring popular
cryptocurrency concepts to the
mainstream. Unlike older, comparable
projects, KISHU introduces holders to
next-gen concepts such as
participation rewards, NFTs,
decentralized exchanges, and more.

Within the first month of its launch,
KISHU made history by surpassing a
$2 billion market cap and over 100,000
holders. This was an unprecedented
milestone for a project of its kind, and
proved the world’s belief in the project.

The KISHU INU project includes...

$KISHU TOKEN

An ERC20 meme token that fosters and
promotes healthy and widespread usage and
decentralization of the project through a
specific reward linked to users’ transactions
involving decentralized wallets. The more
holders use, trade and execute transactions
with $KISHU, the higher the rewards! It's a kind
of automagic ;-)

KISHU SWAP

Decentralized exchange that features custom
functionality and allows holders to trade among
themselves and without any centralized point
of failure any ERC20 token for another.

KISHU CRATE

NFT Marketplace where users can stake
$KISHU in exchange for NFT rewards created
by artists from community contests. The artists
are awarded prizes out of the $KISHU staking
pool.

KISHU PAW PRINT

Wallet tracker where users can track their
prizes and rewards out of $KISHU usage,
current token valuations, wallet balance, and
more.

KISHU sWAG [coming soon!]

A merchandise store run by a ownerless,
stockholderless non-profit organization to
allow $KISHU holders to proudly support
KISHU INU’s fun in the real world, with any and
all proceeds supporting the KISHU INU's
project growth, maintenance and future
features.
Values
