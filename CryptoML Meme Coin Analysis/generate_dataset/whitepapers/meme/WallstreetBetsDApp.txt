WSB DApp
is a community-owned and operated decentralized
version of r/wallstreetbets.

WSB DAO was created to openly encourage the free flow of public information and opinion
into actionable results. So that anyone, everywhere can

YOLO together as one.

WHY
BLOCKCHAIN?

TRADITIONAL ASSET
MANAGEMENT
Traditional asset management focuses on the investment and custody of
wealth. Centralized financial institutions such as Banks and Hedge Funds derive profit from the sale of financial products like bonds and derivatives to retail
investors. When selling these products, banks and other financial institutions
set their own rules while also charging fees for managing these on behalf of
their customers.
Blockchain is a distributed network that enables fair information sharing and
democratic access to freely traded financial assets valued today over $1T in
daily volume.

• Users log in with MetaMask on
WSBDApp.com
• Select an “Exchange Traded Portfolio”™
‘ETP’ eg “WSB Yolo Stonks ETP”
• Send stablecoin to the smart-contract.
• Receive back ETP tokens automatically,
representing their share of the
underlying ETP assets.
The ETP’s are:
• Wholly Collateralized - (each deposit
automatically buys each asset from
DEX’s)
• Instantly redeemable - anytime (each
withdraw automatically sells each asset
from DEX’s).
• Self-Custodial - You hold the keys/coins.
• Subject to standard 2% annual AuM fees
- Use of the accumulated fees are voted
on by $WSB governance token holders.

The WSB DApp solves the problem of fees

benefited centralized financial institutions
for the past hundred years.

WSB DApp
Blockchain is a distributed computing system that creates infallible records of
transactions. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain are examples of new markets
generating enormous wealth held together by individuals.
Using blockchain technology, $WSB Governance token holders vote on regular rebalancing of ETP’s. Think that TSLA
should be 90% instead of 10% of an ETP Portfolio? Vote on it. Votes are weighted according to the size of an individual’s
$WSB holdings before the timer runs out each rebalancing cycle.
The timer is based on a certain predetermined block height for when votes are cast. WSB DApp will start poll on fortnightly cycle to begin with for the initial ETP product. $WSB holders could also submit a proposal for new ETP concepts,
changing of rebalancing frequencies, key industry integrations and much more.
Vote results are public and verifiable on-chain. Votes for rebalancing the ETP Products such as the “WSB Yolo Stonks
ETP” or “WSB Yolo DeFi ETP” and the resulting rebalance is also transparent and on-chain.
The ETP products will contain a 2% per annum management fee. The $WSB Governance token holders will vote on what
to do with accumulated funds. Example only: some may propose to use these proceeds to buy & burn $WSB. Or perhaps
allocating more funds to developers to build further ETP’s. Or even vote to remain locked in the contract creating a giant
honeypot over time which will amass a huge fortune or it could just go to zero, whichever the crowd prefers.
