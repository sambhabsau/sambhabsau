UPDOG IS A HIGHLY DEFLATIONARY,
HIGH REWARDS TOKEN WITH A CHARITABLE TWIST.

Here at UpDog, we are strong believers in the DeFi ecosystem and want to reward participants as much
as we can. We are also strong believers in helping dogs who are down on their luck. This is why we use an
auto-staking, deflationary token model as well as milestones which will automatically trigger donations

to dog shelters and charities.

IN IT FOR THE DOGS

Dogs are a man’s best friend. UpDog is
returning this favour in a big way!

Not all dogs are fortunate enough to live
happy and healthy lives. Thankfully, many
fantastic initiatives worldwide aim to improve
the lives of these four-legged friends. UpDog
rewards its holders and shares its success
with various charities that can use our

support.

For every milestone achieved in valuation, we
will make donations to different charities. We
are proud to announce that we reached the
first three milestones already!
