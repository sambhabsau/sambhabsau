Woofy

The WOOFY token is the blue dog companion token of YFI. Utilizing special Woof technology, it
allows two-way conversion between the two tokens, allowing holders to be exposed to YFI in a
fluffier package.

At its core, WOOFY solves two problems: YFI not being dog themed, and the price of a single YFI
being too high in USD terms.

1 YFI = 1,000,000 WOOFY. YFI and WOOFY can always be exchanged with one another at that fixed
rate using either the WOOFY contract, or the Woofy website.
